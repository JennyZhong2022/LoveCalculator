            Welcome to this great invention of Love Calculator!

            We all know that a name can tell a lot about a person. Names are not
            randomly chosen: they all have a meaning. Love Calculator knew this
            so he made another great invention just for the lonely you!
          </p>
          <p className="p">
            Sometimes you'd like to know if a relationship with someone could
            work out. Therefore Doctor Love himself designed this great machine
            for you. With The Love Calculator you can calculate the probability
            of a successful relationship between two people. The Love Calculator
            is an affective way to get an impression of what the chances are on
            a relationship between two people.
          </p>
          <p className="p">
            To find out what the chances for you and your dream partner are,
            just fill in both full names (both first and last name) in the two
            text boxes below, and press Calculate.
